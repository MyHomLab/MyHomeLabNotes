## Getting Started with CouchPotato Containers

### Choosing a Containerization Platform

Before you begin using CouchPotato in a container, you need to choose a containerization platform. Docker is the most popular choice, but you can also consider alternatives like Podman, containerd, or Kubernetes for large-scale deployments.

For the purposes of this guide, we'll focus on using Docker, as it's widely supported and user-friendly.

### Pulling the CouchPotato Image

Once you've chosen a containerization platform, the next step is to pull the CouchPotato image from a container registry. Official CouchPotato Docker images are available on Docker Hub, a repository for container images. To pull the image, use the following command:

```shell

docker pull linuxserver/couchpotato

```

This command downloads the latest CouchPotato image maintained by the LinuxServer.io community.

### Setting Up Configuration and Data Volumes

Before running your CouchPotato container, you should set up configuration and data volumes to store CouchPotato's configuration and movie data. Create dedicated directories on your host system where CouchPotato can access and store this data.

In the next section, we'll cover the steps to run CouchPotato in a container and configure it for movie management.

## Running CouchPotato in a Container

### Starting a CouchPotato Container

To run CouchPotato in a Docker container, start a new container instance based on the CouchPotato image you pulled earlier. Use the following command to start a CouchPotato container:

```shell

docker run -d

  --name couchpotato

  -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000

  -v /path/to/your/config:/config

  -v /path/to/your/movies:/movies

  -v /path/to/your/downloads:/downloads

  linuxserver/couchpotato

```

Let's break down the options used in this command:

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.

- `--name couchpotato`: Assigns the name "couchpotato" to the container for easy management.

- `-e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000`: Sets the user and group IDs inside the container to match those on your host system, ensuring proper file permissions.

- `-v /path/to/your/config:/config`, `-v /path/to/your/movies:/movies`, and `-v /path/to/your/downloads:/downloads`: Mounts the host directories containing your CouchPotato configuration, movie library, and download directory to the respective directories in the container.

Once the container is

 running, you can access the CouchPotato web interface to configure it for movie management.

### Configuring CouchPotato for Movie Management

Access the CouchPotato web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5050` in your web browser (replace "localhost" with the IP address of your server if you're running Docker remotely). You'll be prompted to complete the initial setup, including language preferences and default download locations.

To add movies to your CouchPotato library:

1\. Click on "Wanted" in the navigation menu.

2\. Use the search function to find movies you want to add to your library.

3\. Click the "Add" button next to each movie you want to download and organize.

CouchPotato will automatically monitor and search for the movies on your wanted list, download them when available, and organize them in your movie library directory.

In the next section, we'll delve into data management, backups, and data persistence within your CouchPotato container.

## Data Management and Backups

### Backing Up CouchPotato Configuration

Regular backups of your CouchPotato configuration are crucial to ensure that your movie library settings remain intact and recoverable in case of issues. To back up your CouchPotato configuration, simply copy the configuration files from the container to a backup location on your host system:

```shell

docker cp couchpotato:/config /path/to/backup/location/

```

You can automate this process by scheduling regular backups using tools like `cron` or dedicated backup solutions.

### Restoring Configuration from Backups

In case your CouchPotato configuration is lost or corrupted, you can restore it from your backups. Simply copy the backup configuration files back into the container:

```shell

docker cp /path/to/backup/location/config couchpotato:/config/

```

After restoring the configuration, restart the CouchPotato container for the changes to take effect:

```shell

docker restart couchpotato

```

### Data Persistence in Containers

One of the key benefits of containerization is the ability to persist data across container restarts or updates. In the Docker command used to start your CouchPotato container, you specified volume mounts for your configuration, movie library, and download directories. These mounts ensure that your data remains intact even if the container is recreated.

In the event that you need to update the CouchPotato container image, your data will remain unaffected. The new container will use the same mounted volumes, allowing you to seamlessly continue movie management.

In the next section, we'll explore how to customize your CouchPotato container to suit your movie library preferences.

## Customizing Your CouchPotato Container

### Configuration Options

CouchPotato offers a wide range of configuration options to customize your movie library management experience. You can access and modify these options through the CouchPotato web interface. Some key customization areas include:
