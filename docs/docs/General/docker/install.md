## Getting Started with Docker
Here's a simple guide to getting started with Docker:

### Step 1: Install Docker
Install Docker for your operating system by following the instructions on the official Docker website.
### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in your project directory that defines how to build your application image. Specify the base image, copy your application code, and configure any dependencies.
### Step 3: Build a Docker Image
Use the docker build command to build a Docker image from your Dockerfile. For example: docker build -t my-app .
### Step 4: Run a Docker Container
Start a container from your image with the docker run command: docker run -d -p 80:80 my-app
### Step 5: Explore Docker Hub
Explore Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/) to find pre-built images for common software components and services.
### Step 6: Learn Docker Compose
Familiarize yourself with Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. Create a docker-compose.yml file to define your application's services.
